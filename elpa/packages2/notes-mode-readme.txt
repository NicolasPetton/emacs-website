WHAT IS NOTES-MODE?
-------------------

(From the info documentation)

Notes-mode is an indexing system for on-line note-taking.
Notes-mode is composed of two parts, the visible part, a major-mode for
emacs to aid note-taking; and the invisible part, scripts which
periodically index your notes for you.
