;;; Commentary:

;; This implements the jump cursor feature found in vim.

;; A jump is added every time you insert a character on a different
;; line.

;; Jumps are remembered in a jump list.  With the C-o and C-i
;; command you can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back
;; again.  Thus you can move up and down the list.

;; Jumps are read and saved in the same configuration file as vim so
;; you can switch back and forth between the two editors

;;;; THANKS:

;; Bram Moolenaar for writing a fine editor and helping needy children
;; in Uganda

;; Stefan Monnier for telling me how to add C-i binding

;; Ted Zlatanov for suggesting to use less agressive key bindings

;;;; BUGS:

;;;; INSTALLATION:

;; put this file somewhere in your load path then put the put the
;; following in your .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'jumpc)
;; (jumpc)
;;
;; Then either:
;;
;; (jumpc-bind-vim-key)
;;
;; Or:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f8>") 'jumpc-jump-backward)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>") 'jumpc-jump-forward)
;;
;; The first will bind C-i and C-o just like vim.  The second bind
;; function keys 8 and 9. Of course you can pick any keys you like.  If
;; you use Emacs on a console you will have to pick the second form as
;; C-i and TAB are the same thing.
;;
;; If you use autoload you don't need to require the file

;;;; TODO

;; search for TODO within the file

;; Add rotate jump list feature in vim
;;   defined as JUMPLIST_ROTATE in mark.c
;;     "If last used entry is not at the top, put it at the top by
;;     rotating the stack until it is (the newer entries will be at
;;     the bottom). Keep one entry (the last used one) at the top."

;; Add a bit of looseness.  For example do not add jump points within
;; three lines of the last one.

;; Add jump list displaying each jump with the file and line in the
;; file.  Clicking on a line takes you to the jump location.

;; Add more commands that will insert jump.  Vim does: "'", "`", "G",
;; "/", "?", "n", "N", "%", "(", ")", "[[", "]]", "{", "}", ":s",
;; ":tag", "L", "M", "H"

;; Remove files that do not exist when reading and writing from
;; configuration file

;;;; VERSION

;; version 1

;; version 2
;;  - don't force vim key bindings
;;  - remove debugging message
;;  - insert a jump moves the index back to top of list
;;  - insert jumps goes back to top of list

;; version 3
;;  - remove deleted files
