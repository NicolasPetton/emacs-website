;;;; ChangeLog:

;; 2015-09-01  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	omn-mode v1.2 release.
;; 
;; 2015-09-01  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Add a full docstring for omn-mode.el
;; 
;; 	Previously, the docstring was a place-holder.
;; 
;; 2015-08-11  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Improved syntax handling for URLs.
;; 
;; 	* (omn-mode): Now sets a syntax-propertize-function to identify URLs
;; 	 more accurately. This addresses mis-identification of "<" and ">" when
;; 	 used as facets.
;; 	* (omn-mode-syntax-table): No longer handles URLs.
;; 
;; 2015-08-05  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	OMN 1.1 released.
;; 
;; 2015-08-03  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Highlighting for Country code identifiers.
;; 
;; 2015-08-03  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Extraneous comments removed.
;; 
;; 	These were implementation ideas and are unlikely to ever happen (by me) 
;; 	as I would rather interact with the reasoner via Tawny-OWL.
;; 
;; 2015-08-03  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Underscore namespace added.
;; 
;; 	genids use an underscore namespace, and we might as well highlight these 
;; 	all in the same way.
;; 
;; 2015-08-03  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Various font-lock keywords added.
;; 
;; 2015-08-03  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Autoloads added!
;; 
;; 2015-08-03  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Cask supported added and ignored!
;; 
;; 2014-10-20  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Revert "Moved to subdirectory."
;; 
;; 	This reverts commit 6bc7a5ca4bcdb10afd3bb227db630fdc7a28e2f5.
;; 
;; 	The files for omn-mode should be at top level in the branch. During 
;; 	checkout the branch name is used to provide the top-level.
;; 
;; 2014-10-20  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Moved to subdirectory.
;; 
;; 2014-10-20  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>
;; 
;; 	Further facets added, extensions removed.
;; 
;; 	max, min, functional and inverse function were missing and have been
;; 	added. Alias was my own extension to OMN and has been removed.
;; 
;; 2013-04-12  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>
;; 
;; 	* omn-mode.el: Fix first line style.
;; 
;; 2013-04-11  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>
;; 
;; 	* omn-mode.el: Fix up copyright notice, plus minor cleanup.
;; 	(omn-obsolete-electric-indent): New var.
;; 	(omn-mode-map): Obey it.
;; 	(omn-mode-entity-keywords, omn-mode-property-keywords): Move before use
;; 	to satisfy the byte-compiler.
;; 	(omn-determine-line-indent): Don't save-match-data for no reason.
;; 	(auto-mode-alist): Use \\' to match end of file name.
;; 	(omn-font-lock-defaults): Use regexp-opt.
;; 	(omn-mode-syntax-table): Don't use "w" syntax for "_".
;; 	(omn-mode): Move make-local-variables to their corresponding setq. Set
;; 	electric-indent-chars.
;; 
;; 2013-04-11  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>
;; 
;; 	Add omn-mode.
;;
