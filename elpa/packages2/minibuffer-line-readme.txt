This package lets you display various status information in the minibuffer
window instead of the mode-line.  Of course, this is only displayed when the
minibuffer window is not already used for other things (e.g. a minibuffer or
an each area message).

The contents and aspect is controlled by the `minibuffer-line-format'
variable and the `minibuffer-line' face.  Their current default kind of
sucks: suggestions for improvements welcome.
