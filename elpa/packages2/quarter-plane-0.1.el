;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides Quarter Plane mode, a minor mode which
;; provides Picture mode style editing (treating the screen as a
;; semi-infinite quarter-plane).  Unlike Picture mode, it is a minor
;; mode (see the Emacs manual for the documentation of Picture mode).
;; Type M-x quarter-plane-mode to enable Quarter Plane mode in the
;; current buffer, and M-x global-quarter-plane-mode to enable it
;; globally.

;; In Quarter Plane mode, the commands `right-char', `forward-char',
;; `previous-line', `next-line', and `mouse-set-point' are rebound to
;; Quarter Plane commands.

;; Known issues:

;; Quarter-Plane mode doesn't work in read-only buffers, where it
;; can't insert spaces.

;; The user doesn't really care about the "modifications" of adding
;; whitespace that's going to be trimmed when he exits quarter-plane
;; mode or saves, but it's still part of the undo history.

;; Both of these are due to the disconnect between what the user
;; really wants--movement of the cursor within the window, regardless
;; of where the text is--and what the mode can actually do--add dummy
;; text to give the cursor a place to move to.

;;; Code:

(require 'picture)

(defvar quarter-plane-mode-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map [remap right-char] 'picture-forward-column)
    (define-key map [remap forward-char] 'picture-forward-column)
    (define-key map [remap previous-line] 'picture-move-up)
    (define-key map [remap next-line] 'picture-move-down)
    (define-key map [remap mouse-set-point] 'picture-mouse-set-point)
    map))

(defvar quarter-plane-saved-values nil)
(make-variable-buffer-local 'quarter-plane-saved-values)

(define-minor-mode quarter-plane-mode
  "Toggle Quarter-Plane mode on or off.
Interactively, with no prefix argument, toggle the mode.
With universal prefix ARG turn mode on.
With zero or negative ARG turn mode off.

Use point movement commands that act as if the text extended
infinitely down and to the right, inserting spaces as necessary.
Excess whitespace is trimmed when saving or exiting Quarter-Plane mode.

Because it works by inserting spaces, Quarter-Plane mode won't work in
read-only buffers.
