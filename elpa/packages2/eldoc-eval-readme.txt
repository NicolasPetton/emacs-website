This package enables eldoc support when minibuffer is in use.

Eldoc info is shown by default in mode-line,
but you can have eldoc info somewhere else by setting
`eldoc-in-minibuffer-show-fn' to another function (e.g `tooltip-show').

By default with this package `M-:' will use `pp-eval-expression'
instead of `eval-expression'; you can change that by setting
`eldoc-eval-preferred-function'.

It also provides a convenient macro to enable eldoc support
in your own functions using minibuffer or in your defadvices,
that is `with-eldoc-in-minibuffer'.

Users of own minibuffer frame will have to set
`eldoc-in-minibuffer-own-frame-p' to non-nil.

You can turn On/Off eldoc support in minibuffer any time
with `eldoc-in-minibuffer-mode'.
