;;; Commentary:

;; Colors mismatched open parentheses with fl-mismatched-face, red by
;; default. Works reliably after Emacs 24.3, in which bug 16247 is
;; fixed.
;;
;; Also colors open and close parentheses which are inconsistent with
;; the indentation of lines between them with fl-inconsistent-face,
;; orange by default. This is useful for the Lisp programmer who
;; infers a close paren's location from the open paren and
;; indentation. The coloring serves as a warning that the indentation
;; misleads about where the close paren is. It may also help to
;; localize the mistake, whether due to a misindented line or a
;; misplaced paren.
;;
;; As an example, consider:
;;
;;   (aaa (bbb "word-a
;;   word-b" (ccc 1
;;                2)
;;        fff))
;;
;; (aaa ...) and (ccc ...) are consistent, so are not colored.
;; (bbb ...) is inconsistent because the indentation of fff is
;; inconsistent with the actual location of the close paren. The open
;; and close paren are thus colored with the fl-inconsistent-face.
;; This example also shows that multi line strings don't cause an
;; inconsistency.
;;
;; Currently, the package only detects close parens that are after the
;; place indentation would predict. A planned feature is to also
;; indicate when the close paren is before.
;;
;; Also planned is to color mismatched close parens.

;;; Code:

;; TODO: Algorithm doesn't account for close paren which is too soon.
;;
;; (abc
;;   (def))
;;   (ghi)
;;
;; (abc ...) are inconsistent parens because (ghi) is indented too far

;; TODO: implement mismatched close parens

;; TODO: Write tests:
;;
;;   ;; Expect (abc ...) is consistent, (def ...) is inconsistent:
;;   (abc a-symbol (a-func-call "word-a
;;   word-b" (def ghi
;;           jkl)
;;
;;   ;; Expect (when ...) is inconsistent:
;;   (when (and t
;;         nil))
;;   ;; After change, expect (when ...) is consistent and last paren mismatched:
;;   (when (and t)
;;         nil))
;;
;;   Given (a ...) inconsistent, change to (a ...(), and verify close
;;   paren is consistent.
