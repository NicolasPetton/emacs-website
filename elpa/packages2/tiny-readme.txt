To set it up, just bind e.g.:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-;") 'tiny-expand)

Usage:
This extension's main command is `tiny-expand'.
It's meant to quickly generate linear ranges, e.g. 5, 6, 7, 8.
Some elisp proficiency is an advantage, since you can transform
your numeric range with an elisp expression.

There's also some emphasis on the brevity of the expression to be
expanded: e.g. instead of typing (+ x 2), you can do +x2.
You can still do the full thing, but +x2 would save you some
key strokes.

You can test out the following snippets
by positioning the point at the end of the expression
and calling `tiny-expand' (default shortcut is C-;):

As you might have guessed, the syntax is as follows:
m[<range start:=0>][<separator:= >]<range end>[Lisp expr]|[format expr]

x is the default var in the elisp expression.  It will take one by one
the value of all numbers in the range.

| means that elisp expr has ended and format expr has begun.
It can be omitted if the format expr starts with %.
The keys are the same as for format.
In addition %(sexp) forms are allowed.  The sexp can depend on x.

Note that multiple % can be used in the format expression.
In that case:
* if the Lisp expression returns a list, the members of this list
  are used in the appropriate place.
* otherwise, it's just the result of the expression repeated as
  many times as necessary.
