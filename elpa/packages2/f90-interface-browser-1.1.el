;;; Commentary:
;; You write (or work on) large, modern fortran code bases.  These
;; make heavy use of function overloading and generic interfaces.  Your
;; brain is too small to remember what all the specialisers are
;; called.  Therefore, your editor should help you.

;; Load this file and tell it to parse all the fortran files in your
;; code base.  You can do this one directory at a time by calling
;; `f90-parse-interfaces-in-dir' (M-x f90-parse-interfaces-in-dir
;; RET).  Or you can parse all the fortran files in a directory and
;; recursively in its subdirectories by calling
;; `f90-parse-all-interfaces'.

;; Now you are able to browse (with completion) all defined interfaces
;; in your code by calling `f90-browse-interface-specialisers'.
;; Alternatively, if `point' is on a procedure call, you can call
;; `f90-find-tag-interface' and you'll be shown a list of the
;; interfaces that match the (possibly typed) argument list of the
;; current procedure.  This latter hooks into the `find-tag' machinery
;; so that you can use it on the M-.  keybinding and it will fall back
;; to completing tag names if you don't want to look for an interface
;; definition.
;; In addition, if you're in a large procedure and want the list of
;; the variables in scope (perhaps you want to define a new loop
;; variable), you can use `f90-list-in-scope-vars' to pop up a buffer
;; giving a reasonable guess.  Note this doesn't give you module
;; variables, or the variables of parent procedures if the current
;; subroutine is contained within another.

;; Derived types are also parsed, so that slot types of derived types
;; are given the correct type (rather than a UNION-TYPE) when arglist
;; matching.  You can show the definition of a known derived type by
;; calling `f90-show-type-definition' which prompts (with completion)
;; for a typename to show.

;; The parser assumes you write Fortran in the style espoused in
;; Metcalf, Reid and Cohen.  Particularly, variable declarations use a
;; double colon to separate the type from the name list.

;; Here's an example of a derived type definition
;;     type foo
;;        real, allocatable, dimension(:) :: a
;;        integer, pointer :: b, c(:)
;;        type(bar) :: d
;;     end type

;; Here's a subroutine declaration
;;     subroutine foo(a, b)
;;        integer, intent(in) :: a
;;        real, intent(inout), dimension(:,:) :: b
;;        ...
;;     end subroutine foo

;; Local procedures whose names conflict with global ones will likely
;; confuse the parser.  For example

;;    subroutine foo(a, b)
;;       ...
;;    end subroutine foo
;;
;;    subroutine bar(a, b)
;;       ...
;;       call subroutine foo
;;       ...
;;     contains
;;       subroutine foo
;;          ...
;;       end subroutine foo
;;    end subroutine bar

;; Also not handled are overloaded operators, scalar precision
;; modifiers, like integer(kind=c_int), for which the precision is
;; just ignored, and many other aspects.

;; Some tests of the parser are available in f90-tests.el (in the same
;; repository as this file).
